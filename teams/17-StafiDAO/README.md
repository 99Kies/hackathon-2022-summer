## 项目整体简介

项目简介：
Establish a highly sticky DAO community, provide continuous and efficient collateral for pos public chain nodes, and provide community users with more pledge income and higher liquidity.
Stafi DAO is a highly autonomous multi-chain community. Community users are divided into: pledge users, lease users and technical service providers.
Pledge function: establish a swap trading pool of stkToken to solve the problem of depletion of liquidity for DAO Pool redemption; pledge users provide liquid collateral for DAO Pool, and users pledge native Token to obtain stkToken, a certificate for redeeming the pledge; community users Initiate proposals for governance and automatically change Pool operating parameters to achieve decentralized community autonomy;
Pledge user income: Hold stkToken to get airdrop reward retToken (used for leasing pledge), and get node pledge reward generated by leasing;
Leasing function: establish a swap transaction pool of retToken to solve the problem of demand circulation;
The lease user obtains retToken from the transaction pool, sets the lease time, burns the retToken and mortgages part of the retToken to lease the pledge from the DAO Pool and pledge it to the Pos node;
Leasing user income: Collectors (validators) receive node technology fees for node pledge rewards, and delegators receive node pledge rewards;
The technical service provider provides technical support and upgrade services for the DAO community;
Technical service provider's income: get technical service fees.
The positioning of DAO is clear and the users are clear. With the healthy operation of the Pool, it will definitely bring better governance, more income and higher liquidity to the three-party users in the community.
Moonbeam related ecology used in the project:
Use zenlink dex as a liquidity trading pool for stkToken and retToken;
Use subquery as a data layer for query governance, voting, airdrops and rewards.
There are 6 team members, two are graduate students, and the rest are undergraduate graduates! The core members of the team have 1-3 years of experience in smart contract development, all of them have transformed from the traditional Internet to the blockchain direction, and have deep programming accumulation! At present, an Ethereum-based wallet system has been developed for the nft minting transaction system in intellectual property,
DAPP such as decentralized voting system.
